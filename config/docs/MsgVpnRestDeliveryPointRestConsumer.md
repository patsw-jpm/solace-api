**tlsCipherSuiteList** | **String** | The colon-separated list of cipher suites the REST Consumer uses in its encrypted connection. The value &#x60;\&quot;default\&quot;&#x60; implies all supported suites ordered from most secure to least secure. The list of default cipher suites is available in the &#x60;tlsCipherSuiteMsgBackboneDefaultList&#x60; attribute of the Broker object in the Monitoring API. The REST Consumer should choose the first suite from this list that it supports. Changes to this attribute are synchronized to HA mates and replication sites via config-sync.
